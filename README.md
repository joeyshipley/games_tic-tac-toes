Ruby Console Tic-Tac-Toe Game
=============================

This version of the tic-tac-toe game was done in ruby for use in the console. The primary focus here was to 'Drive' the development through TDD instead of just testing first.

### Running the tests
From the console, run 'rake'

### Running the game
From the console, run 'ruby program.rb'
